Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer:
	-	An 'instance variable' is a variable related to a specific instance of a class.
	-	It is different in that it is only available through a specific instance of a specific class, while other variables are general.

  Researched answer:



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer:
	-	A 'block' is a 'do end' statement.  The 'do end' can be subsituted with curly braces, and can hold some grouped logic.

  Researched answer:



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer:
	-	Ruby does not need a return statement for functions.  It will always return the value of the last evaluated statement.

  Researched answer:



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer:
	-	It is a way to write your code around organizing it in the form of "objects;" grouping related functions together under one name.
	-	Functional programming, to my understanding, is not "object focused."  I think it's similar to running commands one-by-one, step-by-step.

  Researched answer:



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer:
	-	A 'Class' will tell an Object how to be constructed; it will tell it what it needs to include.  A Class will hold all of the logic, and lay out all variables associated with the object of the same name.
